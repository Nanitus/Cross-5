Cross 5 - Ability pickup, weapon change and dash ability

Throughout the world there is now a glowing green ball floating, if the player picks one up then they will be healed by one health point. If the player picks up the glowing white orb the player will be given the dash ability, the red orb will give the player another life, the life count can be viewed in the pause menu. The orange orb will give the player a new weapon to switch into.

When the player interacts with a weapon, it allows the player tow switch to and from that weapon by adding a check to the player's code that allows them to switch into that weapon. The weapons are colored orange, life orbs that heal the player are green, orbs that give the player a life are yellow and the player's abilities are white.

In the next update the final boss will be added and the map will be updated to be more interactable and fun for the player.
